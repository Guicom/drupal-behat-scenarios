Drupal Behat Scenarios
======================

In this project I'm going to try and document some of the regular scenarios or custom step definitions which may be useful for re-used.

The first port of call for people wanting to learn about Drupal scenarios is to look in api.feature, blackbox.feature & drush.feature from the behat drupal-extention.

This project will be outlining common workflows that aren't set out in those example features



Scenarios
=========

## Drupal

## Domain Access
 - Login as user with specific domain access settings
